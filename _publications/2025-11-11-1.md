Here, we followed a simple idea we hope can be extended to other complex traits - we added together three layers of genetic risk for non-ischemic arrhythmia: high effect coding variants, regulatory elements mapping to them, and common variants thought to influence cardiac form and function. We found that a score combining the total genetic risk set outperforms any subset in isolation
