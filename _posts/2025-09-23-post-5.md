Dr. Monroe was awarded a one-year (2025-2026) fellowship from the NHLBI Cardiovascular Development Data Resource Center! With this support, he aims to develop a quantitative tool that integrates both common and rare genetic variation to improve congenital heart disease (CHD) risk assessment. Using this tool, he also aims to better understand how genetic variation beyond primary pathogenic variants might influence carrier penetrance and expressivity.
