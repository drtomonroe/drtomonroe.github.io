Dr. Monroe's commentary on cumulative genetic liability in telomere biology disorders  
([Read the commentary in *JCI*](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/195921); [Referenced study by Poeschla et al.](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/191107))  
was published in *JCI*. The work referenced has broader implications for heritable complex traits  
where common and rare variants interact to scale risk.
